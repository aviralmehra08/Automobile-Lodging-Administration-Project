# Automobile-Lodging-Administration-Project
Java Collections/Dijkstra's Alagorithm/FCFS Algorithm

The main objective of our project is to manage the details of the routes, vehicles, parking slots, customers, and duration. The purpose of the application program is to reduce the manual overload of work and reduce manpower so as to efficiently provide spaces to the customer at much faster pace, which cannot be achieved unless there is huge manpower. We wanted to reduce the hassle in finding parking spaces and reduce the time of customer as our solution would provide all the details in a single go. 
Sub-Objective:
1. We have used Dijkstra’s algorithm to provide the nearest parking slot. This algorithm works for both directed and undirected graphs. 
2. Using First Come First Serve we avoid the clash between two users who want to access the slot at same point of time. FCFS states that whichever process or in our case a vehicle arrives first at the parking slot will get to use the space first.
